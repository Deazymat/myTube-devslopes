      There's a certain humorous delight in watching League of Legends players
      make their first foray into DOTA 2. The transition isn't always smooth,
      but it is certainly entertaining. It's like watching a veteran swimmer try
      to navigate the waters with a completely different set of rules and
      physics. They're in the same general environment — the familiar world of
      MOBAs — but the experience is a universe apart. A League player might find
      themselves scrambling as they face DOTA 2's vast hero pool, along with the
      absence of their cherished Summoner Spells. Seeing them click furiously to
      move, forgetting they can simply right click, or watching their bewildered
      reactions when they lose gold upon death, is a sight to behold. Some may
      even have the initial reflex to look for the recall button, only to find
      that teleporting back to base now requires a purchasable item. The nuances
      in map control, the strategic importance of the elevated terrain, the
      micro-management of the courier, the layered mechanics of denying creeps —
      these are but a few of the elements that add depth to DOTA 2 and can
      baffle an unprepared League of Legends player. But the humor doesn't stem
      from mockery. Instead, it's a gentle, shared mirth at the universal
      experience of stepping outside of one's comfort zone. After all, the
      thrill of discovering and mastering a new game is part of why we play. The
      stumbles, the confusion, the moment of revelation when things finally
      start to click - all of these make the transition from League to DOTA a
      comedy of errors worth tuning into.
